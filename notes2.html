    <p>JavaScript scopes simply refers to where a contant or variable is accessible by the program. Global scope and local scope are the two common scopes 
        in JavaScript. The local scope is a block scope and doesn't allow variables to be accessed outside. Global scope allows variables to be accessed
    anywhere.</p>
    <p>A non-primitive datatypes are objects in JavaScript. To allow a primitive value to have properties and methods, JavaScript provides wrapper objects 
        for them to behave the same way as objects.</p>
