<section id="objects">
  <p>Objects are variables that contain list of values, written as "name: value" pairs. The values are called properties. Some properties of objects contain a function declaration. They are called methods and are bascially functions. Object property values can be arrays, strings, other objects, numbers etc. Once the value is a function, it is called a method. All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. This means that its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const.</p>
</section>
<section id="arrays">
  <p>Arrays are objects but they are a special type. They contain values or elements of the same datatype and can be accessed with indexes unlike real obects that are accessed with keys. Array is one of the complex data structures in JavaScript that are useful in data storage and retrieval. </p>
</section>
<section id="dom">
  <p>The document object model take all elements on an HTML document as nodes. The HTML tag is the root element or node. It is even the root in HTML. The built in document object is used to element on the webpage. The query selectors allow us to use CSS notation to find the first element in the document that matches CSS selectors provided as arguments.</p>
</section>
<section id="events">
  <p>I learned events are the interactions users have with their devices. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to. Event listeners are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. Instead of the program having to constantly check to see if an event has occurred, the event listener will let it know when the event happens, and the program can then respond appropriately. This allows the program to continue with other tasks while it waits for the event to happen.</p>
